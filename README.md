# ChatCsv_Streamli_app
ChatCSV-Streamlit-App An LLM powered ChatCSV Streamlit app so you can chat with your CSV files.

How to run the app?
OpenAI instantly revokes the API key once it detects that the key has been exposed publicly. So, that's the only thing to take care of.

Generate your OpenAI API key here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

Run locally
If you are running the app locally, then you can freely use the API key.
in app.py, line 11:

openai_api_key = 's#-#####################jz'

#can set the API key directly, if running locally.

Else if you want to keep the key private, store it in an environment variable named 'API_KEY' in your OS and then refer the key in app.py by:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Henceforth make sure to have Streamlit installed in your system. Run the app by:

git clone https://github.com/AIAnytime/ChatCSV-Streamlit-App.git
cd ChatCSV-Streamlit-App
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

Run on Cloud
You can also run this app locally on Streamlit Cloud, which is a free Cloud Hosting Service.
Make a .env file and store the key as

OPENAI_API_KEY='##-###############'

There's already a .gitignore file with .env mentioned in it. If not, make one.
Remaining code remains the same.
